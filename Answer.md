1. In a relational database, the relationship between a "Product" entity and a "Product_Category" entity is often a one-to-many (1:N) relationship. This means:
   One product can belong to only one category (eg, "Electronics").
   However, one category can have many products associated with it (eg, multiple electronic devices like smartphones, laptops, etc., can belong to the "Electronics" category).
   To establish this relationship in the database schema:
   Primary-foreign key relationship: The "Product" entity typically has a foreign key that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" entity. This foreign key usually resides in the "Product" table and links each product to its respective category.
   Referential integrity constraint: A referential integrity constraint ensures that the value of the foreign key in the "Product" table must match a valid primary key value in the "Product_Category" table. This constraint maintains data consistency and prevents orphaned records.

2. Each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it is by using referential integrity constraints in the database schema. This can be achieved    by creating a foreign key constraint in the "Product" table that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. By this constraint, the database will prevent the insertion of a product with a category that does not exist in the "Product_Category" table, thus ensuring that each product has a valid category assigned to it.
